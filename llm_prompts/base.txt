Generate a list of vocabulary words for the target language and CEFR level provided.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, comments, explanations, apologies, or markdown formatting (like ```json) outside the main JSON object itself.

The JSON object must conform exactly to the following structure:
{
  "words": [
    {
      "headword": "string",
      "translation_en": "string" (optional)
    },
    ...
  ]
}

The "words" array should contain approximately the requested number of vocabulary items. Each item must have a "headword". Include "translation_en" if possible.
