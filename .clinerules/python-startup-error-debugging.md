## Brief overview
These guidelines cover common strategies for debugging startup errors in Python applications, particularly focusing on `NameError` and `ImportError` encountered in a Flask project. The goal is to systematically identify and resolve issues to ensure the application can start successfully.

## Handling `NameError`
  - **Check Imports**: When a `NameError` (e.g., `NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined`) occurs, the primary step is to verify that the required module or object is correctly imported in the file where the error originates.
    - Example: Ensure `from typing import Optional` is present if `Optional` is used.
  - **Scope**: Confirm the name is defined or imported in the correct scope. Ensure all necessary standard library modules like `os` or type hinting elements like `List`, `Dict`, `Any` are imported from `typing`.

## Handling `ImportError`
  - **Verify Source**: When an `ImportError` (e.g., `ImportError: cannot import name 'some_function' from 'some_module'`) occurs, check the `some_module.py` file to ensure `some_function` is actually defined there and is exportable.
  - **Circular Dependencies**: Be mindful of potential circular dependencies between modules, which can manifest as `ImportError`s.
  - **Temporary Workarounds for Startup**: If a module attempts to import a non-existent function from another module (e.g., a function yet to be implemented in `firestore_client.py`), and this blocks application startup:
    - Temporarily comment out the problematic import statement.
    - Temporarily comment out any code (e.g., Flask route handlers) that directly depends on the missing import. This allows the application to start so other parts can be tested or developed.
    - Document these temporary changes (e.g., with `TODO` comments or in a task list) to ensure the missing functionality is implemented and the commented-out code is restored.

## Flask Project Specifics
  - **Application Factory & Blueprints**: When using these patterns, ensure that all necessary modules (e.g., `os`, `typing` members like `Optional`, `pydantic.ValidationError`) are imported within the relevant blueprint/route files where they are used.
  - **Pydantic Validation**: If using Pydantic models, ensure `ValidationError` is imported (`from pydantic import ValidationError`) in files where exceptions of this type are caught or handled.

## General Debugging Workflow
  - **Isolate the Error**: Focus on the first error in a traceback, as subsequent errors might be consequences of the initial one.
  - **Iterative Fixes**: Apply one fix at a time and re-test startup to see if the error is resolved or if a new one appears.
  - **Logging**: Utilize application logs and server output to get more context about the state of the application during startup.
  - **Lessons Learned**: Maintain a document (e.g., in a `.cline/` directory) to record debugging steps, findings, and solutions for recurring or complex issues. For instance, `.cline/lessons_learned_startup_error_Optional.md` was used to track the resolution of the `Optional` `NameError` and related import issues.
